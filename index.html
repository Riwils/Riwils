NCS - The Challenge - Summer 2013
75 westminster Bridge Rd, London SE1 7HS
The challenge focused on teamwork and personal development, which provided opportunities to
support peers in developing ideas and co-ordinating an in depth campaign to be presented to
an external audience of adults and young people.
Skills gained during this 12 week programme; listening, team working, researching,
presentation, photography, communication and public speaking. This included supporting and
cooperating with colleagues, generating and developing ideas. I was a member of a team
which main aim was to help address youth unemployment. I participated in a sponsored walk to
help raise money for our campaign day in September.
Interests
Broadway Theatre - Senior Youth Theatre
I work within a group, generating creative ideas for scenes, costumes and dialogue leading up
to playing a role in a final performance to a large audience. I also direct and give constructive
criticism whilst also listening and producing results based on others advice.
